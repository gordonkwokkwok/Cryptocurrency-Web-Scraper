## üìö Introduction
This project aims to collect and analyze data on the top 10 cryptocurrencies from CoinMarketCap. Using Python, the project extracts data on a weekly basis, starting from April 28, 2013, up until July 9, 2023. The extraction process involves scraping the cryptocurrency data for each specific date and storing it in a DataFrame. The collected data is then transformed through cleaning, formatting, and imputation of missing values. Finally, the project loads the processed data for further analysis. The analysis includes time series analysis, correlation analysis, trend analysis, volatility analysis, comparative analysis, and even predictive analysis. By utilizing web scraping techniques and data analysis tools, this project provides valuable insights into the behavior and performance of the top cryptocurrencies over time.

## üéØ Objective
- Collect and Extract Data: Scrape and extract data on the top 10 cryptocurrencies from CoinMarketCap on a weekly basis from April 28, 2013, to July 9, 2023.

- Clean and Format Data: Ensure data accuracy and consistency by performing cleaning and formatting tasks, including handling missing values and standardizing data formats.

- Analyze Cryptocurrency Trends: Identify and analyze trends and patterns in the performance of the top cryptocurrencies, such as price fluctuations, market capitalization, and trading volume over time.

- Predict Future Trends: Utilize the collected data to develop predictive models that can forecast future trends in the cryptocurrency market, aiding in decision-making for investments or trading strategies.
